In an attempt to learn a little bit of Python, I was taking notes of some questions that popped into my mind.

Here it is, unfortunately in no particular reasonable order, but still maybe it can help someone else trying to learn the language basics:

* [How do I create static class variables and methods?][1]
* [What does the double and single asterisk mean?][2]
* [What's the simplest way to create an immutable data type?][3]
* [What is the meaning of single and double underscore before an property name?][4]
* [How to check for types?][5]
* [What is the Python exception hierarchy?][6]
* [Which version of Python the module `mypy` uses?][7]
* [What's the scope of a variable initialized in an `if` statement?][8]
* [How to use Python type hints?][9]
* [How to use assertions in Python?][10]
* [How to update a requirements file automatically when new packages are installed?][11]
* [How to create a `venv` with a different Python version?][12]
* [How to exclude a folder from `mypy` checking?][13]
* [How to make an immutable object in Python?][14]
* [How to hide stuff inside a package?][15]
* [What are the available interfaces to database packages in Python?][16]
* [Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?][17]
* [Why do you need explicitly have the `self` argument in a Python method?][18]
* [What happens when using cyclic imports in Python?][19]
* [How can I create a copy of an object in Python?][20]
* [How do I convert a string to a number?][21]
* [How do I convert a number to a string?][22]
* [How to heck instances of classes?][23]
* [What is duck typing?][24]
* [What's the difference between abstract classes and interfacees in Python?][25]
* [How to understanding slicing?][26]
